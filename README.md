# KindleQuickFormatter

Programed in Java.
Made for me, as I write my novels/stories in plain text, and then need to get them into Sigil for Kindle or general EPUB publishing.

Recently added support for me to make comments in the text, which are used to create outlines and are stripped out of the final product.
